# device-guard

This is the script I use to block Internet under Linux. Run this as root, or in a startup script.

```
device-guard block
```

```
device-guard unblock
```

Note this will reset any firewall on your system. `unblock` will leave your firewall completely open.

Let me know if you find this useful, or you want this adapted for any other use case!
